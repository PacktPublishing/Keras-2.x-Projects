This is the code repository for [Keras 2.x Projects](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/keras-2x-projects?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789536645 ), published by Packt.

**9 projects demonstrating faster experimentation of neural network and deep learning applications using Keras**

## What is this book about?
Keras 2.x Projects explains how to leverage the power of Keras to build and train state-of-the-art deep learning models through a series of practical projects that look at a range of real-world application areas.

This book covers the following exciting features:
Apply regression methods to your data and understand how the regression algorithm works 
Understand the basic concepts of classification methods and how to implement them in the Keras environment 
Import and organize data for neural network classification analysis 
Learn about the role of rectified linear units in the Keras network architecture 
Implement a recurrent neural network to classify the sentiment of sentences from movie reviews 
Set the embedding layer and the tensor sizes of a network

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import autokeras as ak
clf = ak.ImageClassifier()
clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
results = clf.predict(x_test) 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, deep learning practitioner or an AI engineer who wants to build speedy intelligent applications with minimal lines of codes, then this book is the best fit for you. Sound knowledge of machine learning and basic familiarity with Keras library would be useful.
